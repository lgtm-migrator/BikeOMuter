# Description

BikeOMuter is an App, which provides :partly_sunny: weather information for the commute by bike :bike:.
It helps to make the decision if you should go by bike or rather take the public transport.

## Current Features:

* :heavy_check_mark: evaluation of weather information to simplify decision making
* :heavy_check_mark: daily weather information along a route (preferably by bike)
* :heavy_check_mark: support for multiple bike routes
* :heavy_check_mark: weather Information for the originating and the return trip

## Future :bulb:

I still have a lot of ideas how to improve BikeOMuter app, ranging from better *UI/UX* up to using *Machine Learning* algorithms for better weather evaluation.
