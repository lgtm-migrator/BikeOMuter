**BikeOMuter** is a mobile (currently Android only) App, which provides weather information for roundtrip commutes by bike. It facilitates the decision-making by using a traffic light color encoding for evaluating a roundtrip commute. 

Therefore helping you to decide wether to go by *bike* or if it is better to rather *take public transport*.

### Motivation

For longer daily bike commutes (let's say beyond 5 kilometers) you need to check the weather for multiple locations and multiple time points for a round trip to make sure that you will not encounter bad weather. This can get even more tidious for longer commutes involving mutiple cities.

> **BikeOMuter** is here to facilitate this process and help you with the decision making.

The alternative is to always wear appropiate clothing :umbrella: or to simply not care if you get soakingly wet during a storm :laughing:.
